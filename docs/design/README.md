# MJPEG Video Streaming Server with Hardware UI Design Package

## Purpose

V4L2 camera project that captures snapshots, records raw video, streams MJPEG over a local HTTP server, and maps physical buttons into UI actions.

This package defines the project as an implementation-ready embedded system. It covers system architecture, requirements, interface boundaries, runtime design, validation evidence, and phased delivery.
